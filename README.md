# Trip Planner
## Description
This project is a trip planning resource that allows you to create a list of possible trips, add expenses to each trip, and calculate a total cost for the trip. Future releases will include the ability to reorder, rename, and remove trips, as well as adjust names and pricing for each expense within a given trip. They will also include the ability to compare the cost of two or more trips.
