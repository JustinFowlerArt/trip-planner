# Trip Planner
## Description
This project is a trip planning resource that allows you to create a list of possible trips, add expenses to each trip, and calculate a total cost for the trip. It also includes the ability to rename and remove trips, as well as adjust names and pricing for each expense within a given trip. Future releases will also include the ability to compare the cost of two or more trips, upload trip photos, and upload documents or other items to individual expenses.
